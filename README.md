# 🤖 RoYo Logistics: Android Mobile Application (Kotlin)

This repository holds the native code for the RoYo driver and shipper application designed for the Android platform, which is essential for reaching the majority of users in the Central Asian and Russian markets.

## 🚀 Project Vision

The RoYo Android app is focused on broad accessibility, performance on a wide range of devices, and providing a stable platform for drivers to manage their loads, routes, and documentation digitally.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Language:** Kotlin (The preferred, modern language for Android development)
* **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel for modular and testable code)
* **UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose (For modern, declarative UI development)
* **Networking:** Retrofit / OkHttp (Robust and efficient API communication)
* **Tracking:** Google Location Services API for accurate, low-battery consumption tracking.

## 🔗 Backend Connectivity

This front-end application communicates exclusively with the **RoYo Central API** (currently under development/specification). Key features powered by the API will include:

1.  **Route Optimization:** Receiving AI-suggested routes and multi-stop trip plans.
2.  **Load Board:** Instant notifications for new loads matching the driver's current location and vehicle type.
3.  **User Authentication:** Secure login and role-based access for drivers and fleet managers.

## 🗺️ Roadmap (MVP Features)

* **Driver Mode:** Navigation integration, shipment checklist management, and document scanning.
* **Fleet Manager Mode:** Assigning loads to drivers and monitoring fleet performance metrics.
